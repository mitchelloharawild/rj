# RJ

This package provides tools for dealing with the metadata for the R Journal. The overall goal of the package is to automate common tasks performed by the editors, particularly the editor-in-chief.

The files with 'NM' in their names are due to Norm Matloff.  Some of the functions there perform tasks not in the original 'rj' package, while others perform similar tasks but differing in details.  See README.nm for further information.


## Installation

```
# Then install rj
remotes::install_github("rjournal/rj")
```

New editors should be added to the list of editors in `R/email.r`.

## `DESCRIPTION` format

Each submission consists of a directory containing the submission, any correspondence, and a `DESCRIPTION` file.  The `DESCRIPTION` is a DCF (debian control file) file, made up of entries of the following form.

```
Title: Exploring the wonderful world of R
Authors: 
  "John Smith" <john.smith@gmail.com>
Editor: Hadley Wickham
Reviewers: 
  "Marleen Harris" <marline.harris@hotmail.com>, 
  "Roger Swansong" <iloveswans52@yahoo.com>
Status: 
  2012-05-04 submitted,
  2012-05-18 acknowledged [optional comment],
  2012-09-12 out for review,
  2012-10-12 minor revision,
  2012-11-12 accepted,
  2012-12-12 proofed,
  2013-01-01 published
```

Most of these fields are self-explanatory, apart from the `Status` field, which needs a little more detail. Some statuses can be automatically determined:

* If editor field is blank, then status is "Needs editor"
* If reviewers field is blank, then status is "Needs reviewers"

See `valid_status` for a list of all known statuses, and `todo()` for the next action to be taken based on each status.

## Useful actions
  
```
library(rj)
# Make sure your working directory in the articles directory then:

as.article("2010-15")
new_id()
report()

# Accept, reject or withdraw an article, by updating status, moving to
# correct directory and drafting emails.
accept("2010-15")
reject("2010-15")
withdraw("2010-15")

# Similarly, once you have updated the DESCRIPTION you can use
invite_reviewers("2010-15")
# to send out reviewer invites

# You can draft an email from any template in the inst/templates directory
# with email_template
email_template("2010-15", "accept-major")
email_template("2010-15", "online")

# The editor in chief can run
get_submissions()
# to download all pending submission and automatically draft
# acknowledgement emails.

```
